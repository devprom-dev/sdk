# This is an example crontab file
#
# Each line of crontab.txt has the following structure:
# <Minute> <Hour> <Day> <Month> <Day of Week> <Command line>
#
# Position:    Values:
# Minute       0-59
# Hour         0-23
# Day          1-31
# Month        1-12 or use names
# Day of week  0-6 (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday) or use names
#
# Instead of minute, hour, day, month or day of week it's also possible to
# specify a *. A * represents all possible values for that position (e.g. a
# * on 2nd position is the same as specifying all the possible values for hour)
#
# Several values can be separated by commas: e.g. if a command is to #be
# executed every 10th minute so you can specify 0,10,20,30,40,50 for minute.
# A range of values can be specified with a -: e.g. value 0-12 for
# hour -> every hour a.m.
#
# A divider is specified by "/": */2 specified for minute means every second
# minute. 5-10/2 for hour matches every second hour from 5 to 10.
#
# line continuation character: " \"
# please note: there has to be a space before "\". There's no character
# allowed after "\"
#
# a line starting with a "#" is a comment
#
# character '?':
# ... means "time of pycron startup".
# Internally all the ? get replaced by the current time. So if you specify e.g.
# ? ? * * * command
# The command gets executed on startup of the pycron service and then every day
# at the same time (if the computer is not turned off in between).
# If the cron service was started e.g. at 10:29 the command gets executed
# at 10:29 and at 10:29 the following days.
#
# missed tasks ('!' or '*')
#
# On startup of the service pycron checks if there are any missed tasks
# (tasks that should have been executed if the service would have run continuously).
# Only specially marked commands are checked for missed tasks:
#
#    A '!' in front of a command tells pycron to run the command once if the task was missed.
#    A '*' in front of a command tells pycron to run the command as many times as the command was missed.
#
# E.g. if you specify
#
# 0 */2 * * * *"c:\a command.exe"           #run every two hours
# 0 */2 * * * !"c:\a second command.exe"    #run every two hours
#
# and the computer was down between 1:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. the task "c:\a command.exe"
# will get called three times and "c:\a second command.exe" will get called once.
